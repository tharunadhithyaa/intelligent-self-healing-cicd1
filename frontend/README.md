## 🐳 Docker Deployment

The frontend includes a multi-stage production Dockerfile ([Dockerfile.frontend](file:///d:/Project/intelligent-self-healing-cicd/frontend/Dockerfile.frontend)):
1. **Builder stage**: Node 22 Alpine installs dependencies and compiles the Angular app with `--configuration production`.
2. **Production stage**: Nginx Alpine serves static assets from `/usr/share/nginx/html` with fallback routing configured in `nginx.conf`.
