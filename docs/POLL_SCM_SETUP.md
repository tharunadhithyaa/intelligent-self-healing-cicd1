# Jenkins Poll SCM Build Trigger Setup — CivicPulseAI

This guide details how to configure automated build triggers for the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline using **Poll SCM** (Source Code Management Polling).

---

## Overview

**Poll SCM** allows Jenkins to periodically check your Git repository (e.g. GitHub) for new commits. If changes are detected on the monitored branch (e.g. `main`), Jenkins automatically triggers a new pipeline execution.

### Key Advantages:
- **No Public IP or Tunnel Needed**: Works seamlessly when Jenkins runs in a local environment, private cloud, or behind a firewall without needing ngrok or exposed ports.
- **Simple Setup**: Requires no GitHub Webhook secrets, payload URLs, or external network configurations.
- **Resource Efficient**: Only triggers pipeline builds when actual commit hashes differ from the previous build.

## Step 1: Configure Poll SCM in Jenkins Job

Follow these steps to enable automated polling in your Jenkins pipeline:

1. Open your Jenkins dashboard and select the **CivicPulseAI-Pipeline** job.
2. Click **Configure** in the sidebar menu.
3. Scroll down to the **Build Triggers** section.
4. Check the box: ☑ **Poll SCM**.
5. In the **Schedule** text box, enter a valid cron syntax expression.

---

## Step 2: Schedule Expression Reference

Jenkins uses standard `cron` syntax with hash (`H`) parameters for load balancing build triggers.

| Schedule Expression | Frequency Description | Use Case |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| `H/5 * * * *` | Every 5 minutes | Active development & frequent testing |
| `H/15 * * * *` | Every 15 minutes | Standard team workflow |
| `H/30 * * * *` | Every 30 minutes | Light polling / staging builds |
| `0 0 * * *` | Once daily at midnight | Nightly integration testing |

### Example Schedule Configuration:
```cron
# Poll SCM every 5 minutes with randomized offset
H/5 * * * *
```

## Step 3: Verify SCM Polling Execution

Once configured, verify that Jenkins is actively polling your Git repository:

1. Navigate to the **CivicPulseAI-Pipeline** job page in Jenkins.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Git Polling Log** (or **Poll SCM Log**).
3. The log will show timestamped polling attempts and state checks:
   ```text
   Started on Aug 3, 2026 3:45:00 PM
   Using strategy: Default
   [poll] Comparing revisions in option type ...
   > git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree # timeout=10
   > git ls-remote -h https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intelligent-self-healing-cicd.git main # timeout=10
   Done. Took 1.2 sec
   No changes
   ```

### Testing a Change:
1. Make a commit and push to your remote repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: trigger poll scm verification"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Wait for the next scheduled polling interval (e.g. within 5 minutes).
3. Jenkins will detect the commit difference (`Changes found`) and initiate a pipeline build automatically.

## Branch Filtering & Isolation Architecture

The pipeline enforces strict separation between CI source code changes and GitOps deployment state changes:

- **CI Branch (`main`)**: Pushed by developers. Monitored strictly by Jenkins **Poll SCM**.
- **GitOps Branch (`gitops`)**: Pushed automatically by Jenkins upon successful build/test/scan/push. Monitored strictly by **Argo CD**.

### Critical Jenkins UI Setting:
In Jenkins job settings under **Pipeline → Definition → SCM → Branch Specifier**:
- **MUST BE SET TO**: `*/main` (or `refs/heads/main`).
- **DO NOT USE**: `*`, `origin/*`, or `gitops`.

Because Jenkins Poll SCM is restricted to `*/main`, automatic commits pushed to `origin/gitops` by Stage 11 (`update-gitops.sh`) will **never** trigger a new Jenkins build, permanently preventing infinite build loops.

---

## Troubleshooting Poll SCM

### 1. Polling Log Shows "Permission Denied" / 401 Unauthorized
- **Cause**: Git credentials in Jenkins job settings are missing or expired.
- **Fix**: Go to **Configure → Pipeline → SCM → Credentials** and select valid SSH keys or Personal Access Tokens (PAT).

### 2. High CPU or Network Usage
- **Cause**: Polling interval set too aggressively (e.g., `* * * * *` every minute).
- **Fix**: Adjust schedule to `H/5 * * * *` or `H/10 * * * *` to reduce polling frequency.

### 3. Pipeline Triggering Repeatedly (Infinite Build Loop)
- **Cause**: Jenkins Job SCM **Branch Specifier** is set to `*` or wildcard, causing Poll SCM to detect commits on the `gitops` branch.
- **Fix**: Set **Branch Specifier** to `*/main`. Pushing automated GitOps commits to `gitops` will no longer trigger Jenkins CI.

## SCM Polling Configuration & GUI Setup

To configure SCM Polling in Jenkins:
1. Open Jenkins job settings -> **Build Triggers**.
2. Check ☑ **Poll SCM** with schedule `H/2 * * * *`.
3. Under **Pipeline -> SCM**:
   - Set **Branch Specifier (blank for 'any')**: `*/main`
   - Set **Script Path**: `Jenkinsfile`
4. Click **Save**.
